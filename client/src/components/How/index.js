      <h2 className="h2Style">Step 1: Sign up</h2>
      <p>
        Register an account and a family if you are the first of your group to sign up.
        Share your invite link for family and friends to join your group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not the first in your group to sign up? Register with the family code or through the
        invite link so you can join your group.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 className="h2Style">Step 2: Set up your Zoom</h2>
      <p>
        Open up user settings and input your Zoom room code and password. Those that join your
        family group will have access to join the Zoom call.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to start a call, you&#39;ll need to first open the room from
        your Desktop Zoom app. Make sure to turn off the waiting room feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now anyone with your link can join your call through Thanksgiving Together!

      <br />
      <h2 className="h2Style">Step 3: Thanksgiving Together </h2>
      <p>
        Invite your family and friends to join your family group on our app and spend Thanksgiving
        safely and remotely, together.
